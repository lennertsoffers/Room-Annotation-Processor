# SQLite in Android

## Creating a contract

The contract is a schema with constants that will help us define the schema of the tables and columns in the database. It is not obligated to create a contract class, but considered as a best practice since this contract enables us to use the same names throughout the entire codebase.

For each table that should be persisted in the database, we create an inner class defining this table.

```java
public static class Car {
   public static final String TABLE_NAME = "car";
   public static final String ID = "id";
   public static final String MAKE = "make";
   public static final String MODEL = "model";
   public static final String PRICE = "price";
}
```

There are also two lists of queries in this contract class. There is one containing the queries to create all the tables and one containing the queries to drop these tables again.

```java
public static final List<String> SQL_CREATE_ENTRIES = List.of(
       "CREATE TABLE car (" +
           "id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT," +
           "make TEXT," +
           "model TEXT," +
           "price DECIMAL" +
       ");"
);
```

```java
public static final List<String> SQL_DELETE_ENTRIES = List.of(
   "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS car;"
);
```

## DatabaseHelper class

The DatabaseHelper class will be a class containing methods to get a reference to your database instance.

Our DatabaseHelper class extends the SQLiteOpenHelper and overrides the onCreate, onUpgrade and the onDowngrade methods giving them an extended implementation. The SQLiteOpenHelper class provides us with the getWritableDatabase() method which returns the reference to the database instance.

When overriding the onCreate function of SQLiteOpenHelper, we want to execute our SQL to create the tables. We loop over the queries in our previously defined Contract and execute them one by one.

```java
@Override
public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) {
   Contract.SQL_CREATE_ENTRIES.forEach(db::execSQL);
}
```

When overriding the onUpgrade function of SQLiteOpenHelper, we want to execute our SQL to drop the tables. We loop over the queries in our previously defined Contract and execute them one by one. After this, we call the onCreate method so we have an updated version with the correct tables containing the correct fields.

```java
@Override
public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {
   Contract.SQL_DELETE_ENTRIES.forEach(db::execSQL);
   onCreate(db);
}
```

We want the same functionality when downgrading as when we are upgrading, so we can call the onUpgrade method.

```java
@Override
public void onDowngrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {
  onUpgrade(db, oldVersion, newVersion);
}
```

## Inserting entities

Inserting entities in the database is just a matter of putting the values in a new ContentValues instance and then calling the insert method on the database.

```java
SQLiteDatabase db = databaseHelper.getWritableDatabase();
ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
values.put(Contract.Car.MAKE, “Ford”);
values.put(Contract.Car.MODEL, “Fiesta”);
values.put(Contract.Car.PRICE, 0.0);
db.insert(Contract.Car.TABLE_NAME, null, values);
```

## Reading records

Reading values from the database is done by using the query() method of SQLiteDatabase. This method takes 7 arguments where some are nullable:

1. Name of the table to query
2. Projection: An array of names of columns to be returned or null to get all
3. Where clause with an ‘?’ on the spot of the value for this field
4. Values for the previously created where clause: They are escaped because they are passed individually which makes your query immune to SQL injection
5. Group statement
6. Filter for row groups
7. The sort order

```java
SQLiteDatabase db = databaseHelper.getReadableDatabase();
String[] projection = {
	Contract.Car.MAKE,
Contract.Car.MODEL,
Contract.Car.PRICE
};
String where = Contract.Car.MAKE + “ = ?”;
String[] whereArgs = {“Ford”};
String sortOrder = Contract.Car.PRICE + “ DESC”;
Cursor cursor = db.query(
Contract.Car.TABLE_NAME,
projection,
where,
whereArgs,
null,
null,
sortOrder
);
```

The query method returns a Cursor object that provides read-write access to the result set of the query. Iterating over the cursor can be done with the `moveToNext()` method.

To get a value of the current record in the cursor, you need to access it by the column index. Cursor provides different methods to get the correct data type of the value stored in the column.

```java
int makeColumnIndex = cursor.getColumnIndex(Contract.Car.MAKE);
int modelColumnIndex = cursor.getColumnIndex(Contract.Car.MODEL);
int priceColumnIndex = cursor.getColumnIndex(Contract.Car.PRICE);
List<Car> entities = new ArrayList<>();
while (cursor.moveToNext()) {
   Car car = new Car();
   car.setMake(cursor.getString(makeColumnIndex));
   car.setModel(cursor.getString(modelColumnIndex));
   car.setPrice(cursor.getDouble(priceColumnIndex));
   entities.add(car);
}
```
